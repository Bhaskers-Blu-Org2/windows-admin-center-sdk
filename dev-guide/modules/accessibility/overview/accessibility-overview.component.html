    <h2>Windows Admin Center built-in accessibility</h2>
    <p>Windows Admin Center leverages WAI-ARIA extensively to make the application accessible for variety of user bases. Windows Admin Center thrives on built in accessibility within its controls and navigation handled through shell accessibility manager. </p>
